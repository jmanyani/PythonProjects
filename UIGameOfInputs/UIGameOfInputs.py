# Game of Inputs: A fun way to play with lists in Python!
# Description:
# This interactive console game allows players to modify a simple list by replacing elements based on their input. Players can continue 
# updating the list until they decide to stop. Itâ€™s a fun way to practice input handling and list manipulation in Python!
